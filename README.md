Manufacturing Breakpoint Manager Application

An application for keeping track of Manufacturing Breakpoints.
A manufacturing breakpoint is a point in time where any element of the manufacturing process is changed and the company needs to keep track of what outgoing products were made during the changed process.

For example, if a product is made with items from a certain supplier but for some reason that supplier is unable to supply items for 3 months. A different suppliers items can be used and a breakpoint placed on outgoing products to keep track of which products used the new suppliers items.
